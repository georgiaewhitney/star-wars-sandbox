# Star Wars Sandbox

This is a sandbox project for playing around with the Star Wars API (SWAPI). It allows you to generate a random character from the Star Wars universe and display some information about them.

The SWAPI is not fully-fledged, so it's a very bare bones operation at the moment. 

## Getting started

To get started, simply click the "Generate Character" button on the page. This will fetch a random character from the SWAPI and display their name and birth year.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) - the Star Wars API used to fetch character data

## Credits

This project was created by [Georgia](https://github.com/georgiaewhitney) for some May 4th fun. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own Star Wars projects!
